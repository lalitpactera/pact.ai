Looked at this again today and was not able to fix the problem.<br>Tried opening in Visual studio, but got duplicate errors and platform errors.<br>This doesn?t fix the problem, but needs a fix ? please remove duplicate in the src.vcxproj file as shown:<br>src.vcxproj:173:    <br>src.vcxproj:177:    <br> <br>src.vcxproj:103:    <br>src.vcxproj:115:    <br>src.vcxproj:116:    <br>src.vcxproj:131:    <br> <br>The fix I wanted to try is discussed here:<br>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21399650/cannot-include-both-files-winsock2-windows-h?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1<br> <br>it specifically calls out the *order* of the include files as the fix.   Specifically this link<br>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1372480/c-redefinition-header-files-winsock2-h<br> <br>says that wrong order causes the error.   Please ?do that?.    We assume winnt.h has the same trouble as windows.h<br> <br>Separate issue, not related, but maybe important.   Searching the codebase for examples we saw<br>    8.1<br> <br>Was not used.   Projects are using windows 10 so they pickup the security changes ? shipping downlevel code could run into security trouble? if you have a choice, I?d try to target 10 as shown:<br> <br>10.0.10586.0<br> <br>Sorry, can?t help more here.

Swati Mishra (PACTERA TECHNOLOGIES INC) (v-swmi@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>Hi Carrie,<br> <br>We don?t own <br>https://cloudbuild.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/CloudBuild/_git/CloudBuildConfig/'so<br> we cannot provide ermissions.Look like cloudBuild own it. Can you look into this?<br> <br>Thanks,<br>Swati<br> <br>http://aka.ms/onebranch |<br>http://aka.ms/OneBranchImplement<br> <br>
Carrie Zhao (Myriad Consulting Inc) (v-zhayan@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>Yes, we own it and provide permission to power user.<br>I mean do you know if there is a SG that already have power user permission from onebranch team that Pengfei can join?<br> <br>Thanks,<br>Carrie<br> <br> <br>
Carrie Zhao (Myriad Consulting Inc) (v-zhayan@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>If there isn?t one, <br>@Pengfei Huang, please go ahead create a SG and request power user permission for your team. That should only take less than a day to complete the process.<br> <br>Thanks<br>Carrie<br> <br>
Carrie Zhao (Myriad Consulting Inc) (v-zhayan@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>It would be also helpful if you check with the power users who already made change in this current queue from your team, and see what SG he is in that can get the power user permission. That saves much more time as well.<br> <br>Thanks,<br>Carrie<br> <br>

Carrie Zhao (Myriad Consulting Inc) (v-zhayan@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>There isn?t any requirement from our side.  You can just request the power user permission on behalf of the SG that you want to give power user permission access to.<br> <br> <br>
Pengfei Huang (phuang@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>@Carrie ? where can I request it? Do you have a link or email that I can contact? Thanks.<br> <br>
Carrie Zhao (Myriad Consulting Inc) (v-zhayan@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>Per the wiki page: <br>You can request your power users security group (*not* a distribution group) be added to QBranchPowerUsers through<br>http://idweb/.<br> <br>
Pengfei Huang (phuang@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>I see... let me try... Thanks! <br> <br>

Charlie Wickham (Charlie.Wickham@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>I looked for this and found a better explanation (sort of) as to what this means. The compiler team has augmented this error code to a DLL is missing (Microsoft.DiaSymWriter.Native..dll or something like that). For now, since all<br> our builds are broken, we should just remove that (@Fab Tillier this was in your validate IPs<br> deployment tool: did you set that purposefully?). I?ve disabled it in one of my branches and just submitted a buddy. We can see where that goes.<br> <br>Fab: did you create this project with VS2017? Doesn?t look like it but checking?<br> <br>c<br> <br>
Charlie Wickham (Charlie.Wickham@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>Should be DiaSymReader (which includes the writer). In any case, I am finding it corext build packages so there is something else we probably need to enable in the build in order for this DLL to be available to the compiler. I still vote<br> for turning it off until someone can devote some time to figuring out why.<br> <br>c<br> <br>
Tony Wang (tonywa@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>I have confirmed that by flipping ?Deterministic? to false in<br>ValidateReservedIPs.csproj can solve this issue.<br> <br>
Fab Tillier (ftillier@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>I did create the project initially with VS2017, and then had to manually edit it to make the tools version compatible with our build system.  I have no problem turning it off, not even sure why it?s there?  Certainly wasn?t purposeful.<br> <br>-Fab<br> <br>
Charlie Wickham (Charlie.Wickham@microsoft.com) says: <br><br>The missing DLL needs to get on the path or in some property such that the compiler can find it when writing the pdb file. Might need a msbuild.corext version upgrade.<br> <br>c<br> <br>
