The suction hose does not reach the top of a 205 L drum which leads people to either tip the 200KG drum over risking spills or an ergonomic injury or both. Or if the drum is full enough for the short dip tube to reach the liquid the drum can be fork lifted from the budded pellet allowing the suction hose to be kinked and forced in introducing other hazards.  Also because the pipe work holds about 3 Kg it?s difficult to get the mix ratio correct which could effect quality, if you accidently add the 3 kg in the pipe you need to add 60K of oil which will over fill the vessel. It was understood these drums were going to be batched into the correct vessels in the appropriate amount for our batch mix.

3032,"Due to a fault on line 2 extruder, the start of the extruder has become troublesome. Operations have found a way to start the extruder and maintain production.

The 'new' process involves manually engaging a dog clutch whilst it is rotating.

Dog clutches are designed to be engaged whilst stationary. Friction clutches are designed to be engaged whilst rotating.

The SOP for starting the extruder clearly states.... 'Engage Auxiliary Drive clutch Manual task, moving clutch lever.
Note: The Auxiliary Drive may have to be ?jogged? if the clutch teeth do not line up preventing the movement of the lever for engagement
WAIT for the clutch faces to stop moving before engaging the clutch'

The continued practice of engaging the rotating dog clutch may put extreme forces on the stationary shaft and produce a 'shear' failure of the shaft (if it hasn't already started too).

There may also be some personal safety issues with this method of extruder start.

3465,"LBC Overhead river water exchanger was scheduled for cleaning and inspection during the 2017 Spring Outage, starting on March 26, 2017.  Per the Unit Shutdown procedure, instructions were to ""clear both sides of the river water condenser to make first breaks on Sunday afternoon, (3/26/17)"".  This activity was verified to be complete on 3/26/17.  Following 4 days of cleaning on the water (tube) side of the exchanger, it was realized that the process side (shell) contained hexane residual and was not LEL free, indicating incomplete clear up of the process side of the exchanger.  Prior to plugging tubes in the exchanger, following inspection, the process side was cleared, verified LEL free, and work proceeded to plug the tubes.  The cleaning that had taken place over the previous 4 days was non-intrusive to the process side of the exchanger, so no exposure or release of the hexane residual occurred. The process side was drained, isolated, and pressured up to about 5 psig with nitrogen.  The process side was not completely cleared of LEL, however, which was required by the shutdown procedure.  Risk of exposure during the cleaning process was very minimal due to the low pressure equipment used to clean the tube side and isolation of the tube and shell sides of the exchanger by exchanger design.  However, in the event that a large hole or leak in a tube were present, the risk of exposure to personnel was a potential.  Clear up of the process side was not required because of the work planned, but more as an efficiency for having the equipment ready in the event we needed to add to the scope and work on the process side.  There was no liquid hexane present in the shell side of the exchanger, but LEL measurements indicated about 25%, which would have been too high for a process opening.  The Clear up on this shell side of this exchanger was not completed by removing all hydrocarbon residual and achieving 0 LEL, which would be required for a process opening.",Level0

Immediate investigation determined that the 120V and 208V supply breakers to the unit electrical panels had been properly locked out, but that the 480V breaker supplying power had not been locked out.   No work had been completed in the 480V unit panel during the time that it was thought to be locked out. In addition, each 480V circuit on the unit has an ON/OFF switch installed immediately downstream of the Distribution Blocks, and all were found in the OFF position. 
 
LOTO was initially applied to the Oxidation Pilot Plant in October 2016 at the start of a unit revamp.  At that time, all Distribution Blocks in the two unit mounted electrical panels were confirmed de-energized by a company I&E Technician. The Distribution Blocks were checked twice more during the revamp activities and were confirmed both times to be de-energized. The last of these checks occurred in mid-January and was witnessed by the engineer overseeing the revamp project.    
 
The only 480V circuit electrical work completed to date during the revamp was to reconnect the wiring to an agitator motor that had not been used in the previously completed experiments run on the unit.  The I&E Technician had verified that the motor wires were disconnected from the contactor located in the unit electrical panel,  and that the test meter showed they were de-energized at the motor end, prior to completing this work.  As the wires were disconnected at the contactor,  at no time was the I&E Technician at risk while performing this task. 
 
At this time it is not know when or why the 480V breaker in the distribution panel was turned on, energizing the circuit to the unit mounted electrical panel.

HP550J is not a particularly slippery product and the stretch hood on pallets produced at the same time had reached all the way under the pallet, so there are no indications why the pallet would be unstable. There had been some recent under-weight bags which can cause a bit of tilt in the pallet, but the other similar pallets are fine, and the tilt is not likely to be severe enough to cause sliding off the tynes. There are no other obvious reasons why the pallet would slide off the forklift tynes except that perhaps the forklift stopped suddenly or that the tynes were not angled sufficiently to maintain the pallet on the tynes.

?	A number of bags have had no inner tie-string meaning that they unload as soon as the outer tie is undone and can be unsafe and cause spillages,
?	A bag last week had no ties at all, so when it was lifted from the pallet it basically dumped completely on the floor resulting in significant wastage and health issues to recover and clean-up,
?	The bag chutes seem to be very wide, which makes controlling or throttling the flow quite difficult.

From previous recent complaints, it is evident that these are certainly not the first issues that we?ve had with the Sunace bags, and it unfortunately appears that we are not making any real progress.

Please review and respond asap, as I am not comfortable with this potential safety issue and lack of quality control. In fact, it may be beneficial for Sunace to visit the plant and explain their performance.

Operations removed workers from the immediate vicinity of the flame, and the fire watch on duty for the hot work at the site extinguished the fire.  Another small flame (approx. 1?) was found directly above the bleed where the first fire was found, coming from a leaking valve packing.  Again, the fire watch put out the fire.  A water hose was used afterward to cool the metal around the fires to prevent further ignition of hydrogen leak-by.

Before hot work had begun at the job site, Operations had expressed the need for heightened awareness regarding hydrogen fires, given hydrogen?s propensity for leaking and the fires? low detectability during the day. During the permitting process, the Operator had explained how to detect hydrogen fires, to notify them if any were located, and requested that additional fire blankets be used to contain sparks.  This led to ETS being able to find the flames before anyone had inadvertently walked into one and gotten burned.  Operations had been standing by the hot work area and were able to confirm the leaking hydrogen had not been contacted by stray sparks.

5187,"On Wednesday 7 September, there were a number of compromises of the Lock Out Tag Out (LOTO) system when :-
1.	a Clearance was issued to spade a vessel before the Lock Box was locked, 
2.	the Fitter spaded the vessel as requested, but did not lock on to the Lock Box,
3.	the Lock Box had not been provided by the Turnaround Team.

Isolation for the plant during the Turnaround was decided to be done with 2 large Lock Boxes (11 & 14), each with ~160 & 120 locks and with isolations lists from many different areas around the plant, rather than using multiple smaller Lock Boxes. The fact that this was a complex and difficult LOTO process was raised numerous times leading up to and during the shutdown of the plant, including by the AGSTs involved in this event.

During the busy week of shutting down, gas freeing and isolating the plant in preparation for the flare spades and Turnaround maintenance, there has been high pressure to progress through the long work list as quickly as possible. This lead to a situation where Fitters were asked to spade V1313 before the Lock Box 14 had been locked. Lock Box 14 was not locked as there were still a number of other isolations processes in progress around the plant. The AGST and Fitter had checked that the equipment was de-pressured, gas free and hence safe to enable the work to safely progress. The other isolation lists that had not been completed and hence prevented the Lock Box from being locked were judged as not having any bearing or risk on the spading of V1313.

Another AGST made the same judgement and provided a Clearance Certificate and the Fitter then inserted the required ~6 spades, however he did not lock his personal lock onto the Lock Box. In fact, a Lock Box was not available as it had not yet been fabricated and provided by the Turnaround Team.

Similar events have occurred during the spading of U1700 and other areas during the shutdown & gas freeing week in preparation for the Turnaround maintenance.

The key areas for improvement are as follows :-
?	The operations AGSTs and the Fitter should have stopped and asked for guidance before allowing maintenance on an unlocked Lock Box.
?	The Fitter should have locked onto the Lock Box before doing the maintenance work.
?	The use of 2 large Lock Boxes rather than multiple smaller Lock Boxes has caused a lot of unnecessary complexity, confusion and delayed work progress.
?	The correct large Lock Box was not available as preparation for the Turnaround has been late, under?resourced and not well progressed

The Operations Manager has spoken to all involved as well as the full Turnaround Operations Team, and will issue a summary and corrective actions to the full Operations & Maintenance personnel.

The BCO A Shift Supervisor called Business Coordinator 5 minutes later to state that the EMPTY railcar in question was released from the BCO facility and was in transit to supplier and that the railcar in question was no longer onsite.  The issue is that LYB is to receive notification of loaded railcars with temperature rise of 3 degrees within 3 hours, or reaches 95 degrees C.   Since the railcar was empty, this notification of temperature limit reached was considered a false report.  An immediate text to the BCO GPS response team was made to advise of the false report of the railcar.
Approximately 20 minutes later, Business Consultant received a second notification on another railcar UTLX 8902854.  This report turned out to be the same issue of temperature rise to railcar.

Business Consultant followed up regarding this situation at the BCO facility with the Raw Materials Coordinator to discuss and obtain from IONX, LLC the clarification as to why these alarms were sent erroneously, when the railcars where sent out of the facility empty.

I pulled off I-280 SR 795 exit ramp in the southern Toledo, Ohio area to get gas for my fleet car.  The gas station was very busy.  There were multiple trucks with trailers at the pumps on the outside access ports of pumps.  I observed open pumps in the middle access lanes of the service pumps.  I began to circle counter clock wise around 2 trucks to access the open pumps.  In the process of maneuvering around the front of the pickup & boat trailer, I paused for 2 patrons walking  in front of my car heading into the service station shop, while one patron exited the shop.  After they cleared I eased of the brake to move to open pump and failed to observe another man quartering from my drive side left  between the pump and pick up, he stepped in front of my vehicle and I struck him from behind, knocking him to the ground.  I stopped immediately to assist the downed individual. He Identified himself as Marvin.  I attempted to call 911 for assistance.  At that time the gas station Manager came out to advise she had already called 911. 

EMT?s and police arrived in minutes.  By the time they arrived Marvin had already risen to his feet.  EMT attempted to attend to Marvin.  He and his wife declined EMT services for him.  I reported my account of the incident to Sargent Sims of the Lake Township Police department (Tel: 419-838-6651).  
No citation was issued.  Sargent Sims recorded Incident Number 2016-0752 for the parties involved.  I have requested a copy of his incident report  by E/mail from Jeanne@laketwp.com.  As of Friday, 06/24/16, I have not received.

He drove over the ramp slowly at which time the trailer came off the ball hitch on his truck.  The trailer chains were installed so the trailer did not get away from him however there were several mistakes made.

1. The trailer jack was not fully raised during travel.  So as he traversed over the mounded gravel the bottom of the jack pushed the hitch off the ball allowing the trailer to fall.
2.  He also admitted he had not secured the hitch down in the locked position over the ball before moving the trailer. When traveling the hitch lever should be down to lock the hitch onto the ball and then be pinned or locked.

After the trailer fell off the ball, the trailer rolled forward where the hitch lever was forced down in the locked position as the trailer struck the bumper. The  hitch appears to have been damaged prior to entering the plant, hard to say for certain.

The technician was not in the line of fire and the incident occured outside the sidewalk.

Nobody was injured and the IBC stayed intact. Thus, there was no spillage of liquid compound inside the IBC.

The incident analysis resulted in 3 major contributions to the incident:
* Very high balance point
* Uneven floor with slight inclination
* Centrifugal force due to curve movement
The IBC on top of the collecting drip pan was moved due to a lack of possibilities to position the IBC on top of the collecting drip pan at the planned destination.
Prevention of future incidents:
* Publication of the incident analysis to all employees at the site.
* The collecting drip pan will be stored at the ground floor, where a forklift can position the IBC on top of the collecting drip pan.
* Update instruction manual.
